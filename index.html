            <figcaption>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around
                the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god
                Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals,
                corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (·ºôœÅŒº·øÜœÇ). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit
                as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28¬∞.

            <figcaption>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
                As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be
                visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[18][19] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never
                appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a
                little while before dawn.

            <figcaption>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
                While large amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid
                surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes
                and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands.

            <figcaption>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being
                larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often
                referred to as the "Red Planet".[17][18] The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on
                Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance, that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies
                visible to the naked eye.

            <figcaption>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant
                with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined,
                but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object
                in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after
                Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.[22][23]
                It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95
                times more massive.

            <figcaption>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky,
                Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus
                (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest
                planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk
                chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn</figcaption>
